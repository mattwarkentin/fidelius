The goal of `fidelius` is to provide a simple way to encrypt your static HTML files and provide simple password-protected in-browser decryption. 

This package drew heavy inspiration from both the [`staticrypt`](https://github.com/robinmoisson/staticrypt) and [`encryptedRmd`](https://github.com/dirkschumacher/encryptedRmd) projects.
